# CareerExplorer
The project is a platform where recruiters and job seekers can find each other.

The project will contain 2 modules:

1) Recruiters can post vacancies, see users who applied to the vacancies, and open a dialog in case of interest.
2) Job seekers can fill out their profiles with their CVs and contact information, and apply for vacancies.
